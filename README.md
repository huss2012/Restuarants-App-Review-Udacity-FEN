---
## Introduction:
This project is based on the Front-End-Nano-Degree-Program for Udacity.
It is the last project on that Nano-Degree.

### Installation & Runing:
1. Frist of all, you have to clone or download the ZIP format in your local machine.
2. Scondlly, If you download in the ZIP format unzip it. If not skip this step.
3. thirdly,  in your git CLI or the shell navigate to the location of the repo. In other word cd into it.
4. then,  In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 3000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
    * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 3000`.
5. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
